# 100-Day Kubernetes Challenge with Minikube

Welcome to the 100-Day Kubernetes Challenge with Minikube! This challenge is designed to help you learn and master Kubernetes using Minikube, a local Kubernetes cluster that you can run on your development machine.

## What is this Challenge?

The 100-Day Kubernetes Challenge is an intensive learning program where you will spend 100 days learning, practicing, and exploring Kubernetes concepts and practical usage with Minikube. Each day, you will be given a specific task or topic to cover, ranging from basic Kubernetes concepts to more advanced topics.

## Who is This For?

This challenge is ideal for developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone interested in learning Kubernetes without the need for cloud-based Kubernetes platforms. If you have a basic understanding of containers and some command-line experience, you're all set to embark on this journey!

## How to Participate

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. It will be your personal space to track your progress and store your solutions.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

3. **Install Minikube**: If you haven't installed Minikube already, follow the installation instructions provided in the [Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

4. **Create a Daily Log**: In the root of the cloned repository, create a daily log file (e.g., `Day01.md`, `Day02.md`) to track your progress, learnings, and any code/scripts you write each day.

5. **Start the Challenge**: Every day, check the [Issues](../../issues) section of this repository for the daily challenge or task. Each issue will have a description of the task for that specific day.

6. **Work on the Challenge**: Follow the instructions in the daily challenge issue to complete the task of the day. Use Minikube to experiment and apply the concepts you learn.

7. **Record Your Progress**: Update your daily log file with the details of the task you completed, any resources you used, and any difficulties you faced. Add code snippets or configuration files if relevant.

8. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: After completing the challenge for the day, commit and push your changes to your forked repository.

9. **Check Solutions and Discuss**: Solutions for each day's challenge will be posted in the [Pull Requests](../../pulls) section. Feel free to compare your solutions with others and participate in discussions.

10. **Repeat for 100 Days**: Repeat steps 5 to 9 for the next 100 days, and see your Kubernetes skills grow exponentially!
