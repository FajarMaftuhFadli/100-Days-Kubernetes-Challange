## Using a Service to Expose Your App

The **Service** allows us to access the application on our Pods. Within the Service, we can specify the **Pods** to which we want to direct traffic. The Service has various ways to be exposed by defining its type:

- **ClusterIP (default)** - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.

- **NodePort** - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Superset of ClusterIP.

- **LoadBalancer** - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.

- **ExternalName** - Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. This type requires v1.7 or higher of kube-dns, or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher.

To expose our previous Pods we can use **expose** subcommand, define the type to **NodePort**, set the port to 8080

`kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080`

Let see our services:

`kubectl get services`

```
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes            ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          4d5h
kubernetes-bootcamp   NodePort    10.98.21.129   <none>        8080:31536/TCP   10m
```

We can also view the detail of our service.

`kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp`

```
Name:                     kubernetes-bootcamp
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   app=kubernetes-bootcamp
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 app=kubernetes-bootcamp
Type:                     NodePort
IP Family Policy:         SingleStack
IP Families:              IPv4
IP:                       10.98.21.129
IPs:                      10.98.21.129
Port:                     <unset>  8080/TCP
TargetPort:               8080/TCP
NodePort:                 <unset>  31536/TCP
Endpoints:                10.244.0.20:8080
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
```

In the above output, we can see some important info such as Port, Labels, Type, etc.

Since we utilize minikube within a docker, it becomes necessary to execute this command. By doing so, minikube establishes a tunnel connecting the minikube cluster to our local machine and assigns the service to the local port.

`minikube service kubernetes-bootcamp --url`

```
http://127.0.0.1:54449
‚ùó  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.
```
